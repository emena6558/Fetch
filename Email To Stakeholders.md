Hi Jerry,

Our team has reviewed the JSON files you provided and conducted some basic analysis. During this process, we noticed a few data quality issues that are affecting our ability to fully answer your question:

1) **Missing Barcodes** in REWARDS_RECEIPT_ITEM_LIST: Many items in the REWARDS_RECEIPT_ITEM_LIST are missing barcodes, which makes it difficult to accurately identify the products associated with each receipt or transaction. This leads to incomplete or inaccurate reporting. While we can attempt to use the product description to identify the brand, this approach may introduce potential mismatches or inaccuracies.

2) **Duplicate Barcodes for Different Items:** We also found instances where the same barcode is assigned to different products. This creates confusion in product identification and could result in errors in reporting and analysis.

To help resolve these issues, I’d like to clarify the following:

How should we handle missing values or nulls, particularly for fields like barcodes or product descriptions?
* Are there any predefined rules or standards for how data should be formatted or validated across tables (e.g., barcode formatting, timestamps, etc.)?
* Is there a master mapping table or reference data set where we can find all barcodes listed with their corresponding correct items? This could help ensure consistency across the dataset.
* We’ll need to address these issues to ensure the data is clean and complete for reporting. Let me know if you have any preferences on how you'd like us to proceed with these gaps, or if you'd like more details.

Looking forward to your input!
